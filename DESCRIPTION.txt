As the penguin you are about to use a rock as a weapon to throw at the attacking seals and birds. Once you have killed a certain number of enemies more will appear as you progress. The boss level of the game begins after you have killed a certain number of enemies, at which point you will be attacked by an oil barren in a British petroleum hot air balloon.
